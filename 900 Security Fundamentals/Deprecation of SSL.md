# Deprecation of SSL

## Summary
Was the first protocol invented for encrypting network traffic, specifically for HTTP. Developed by NETSCAPE, and now superseded by TLS. Still used often in conjunction to TLS as the naming has stuck due to popularity.

## Details
- Provided the first steps in securing communication between client and server
- Highly exploitable
- Not found anywhere unless the site is from the 95-20's and has been updated since

## Why It Matters
Its important to note that SSL is not used anywhere other than by name as a reference to secure communication. Any server running SSL is either extremely outdated and highly exploitable.
