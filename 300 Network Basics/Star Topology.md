# Star Topology

In a star topology, hosts are all connected to a **central device** (hub, switch, router, or access point). This topology is widely used today in households and small networks.  

- **Fault tolerance** is good for cable failures — a single cable issue won’t bring down the network.  
- **Single point of failure**: if the central device fails, the whole network goes down.  
- **Troubleshooting** is straightforward: if everything breaks, check the central device; if only one host is affected, check its connection or settings.  
- Compared to bus topology, a star **delivers data only to the intended client**, avoiding collisions on the network.
- Higher cost due to higher cable usage.
