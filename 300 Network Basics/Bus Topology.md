# Bus Topology

In a bus topology, all hosts are connected along a **single backbone cable**, often forming T-shaped branches to reach individual devices.  

- **Easy setup and low cost** make it suitable for very small networks.  
- **Single shared medium**: all data passes through the same cable, so **collisions** are common and **eavesdropping/sniffing** is trivial.  
- **Fault tolerance is low**: if the backbone fails, the entire network goes down.  
- **Troubleshooting** is difficult because a fault anywhere on the bus can affect all devices.  
- **Adaptability is limited**, and scalability drops as more devices are added.  
- This topology is largely **outdated** in modern networks.
