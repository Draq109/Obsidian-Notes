# Peer-to-Peer Networks (P2P)

## Summary
Is a distributed type of network where each user is equal in authority. All systems in place make up the essence of that network, with each peer contributing some form of resource or storage. Often seen in small environments where number of workstations are low. 

## Details
- Security validating can get messy as each peer manages security before having another peer connect.
- Backing up data can be tedious due to having different data stored on other devices. 
- Shared data could be a pain to keep up to date on each machine, that is keeping files in sync with each workstation
- Shared resources could be slow if many workstations are requesting that service or theres traffic congestion.

## Why It Matters
Peer-to-peer (P2P) is best understood not as a fixed type of network, but as a **communication model**. While textbook diagrams show P2P in its simplest form, in practice it’s applied alongside client–server models. Modern networks rarely rely on only one approach—most devices and services use a mix of both, depending on what’s being provided and how connections are established.

Example: 
Downloading files from my brothers PC to mine (P2P). While simultaneously watching netflix on my PC (client-server)
