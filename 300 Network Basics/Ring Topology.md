# Ring Topology

In a ring topology, each host is connected to **two other devices**, forming a closed loop. Data travels in **one or both directions** around the ring until it reaches its destination.  

- **Predictable data flow** makes it easier to manage traffic than a bus.  
- **Fault tolerance is limited**: a single cable or device failure can break the loop unless a **dual ring** or **fault-tolerant mechanism** is used.  
- **Troubleshooting** is easier than bus for identifying which segment failed, but still more complex than star.  
- **Scalability** is moderate; adding or removing devices can disrupt the network temporarily.  
- This topology is less common today, mostly used in **specialized industrial or legacy networks**.
