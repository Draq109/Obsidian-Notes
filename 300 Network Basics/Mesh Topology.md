# Quick Note â€“ Mesh Topology

Mesh topology involves interconnecting all hosts on a network to each other. In the case of 4 hosts, that would mean each host would have 3 connections. 
- **Fault Tolerance**: Very high, not one single point of failure with various connections to utilize in the case one fails.
- **High cost**: Lots of cabling used to achieve a mesh, plus any new host addition will require n - 1 cables (n = number of host)
- **Adaptability:** Not very high, adding more hosts becomes more complex and costly. As well as troubleshooting exact failing points can be hard.
- **Main advantage**: Mesh shines in an environment where down time is not allowed, so having high fault tolerance is essential. Such as our ISP or famous Web Applications.
