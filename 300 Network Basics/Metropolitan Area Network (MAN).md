# Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

## Summary
MANs scope over a university, multiple buildings, or even a city. Its bigger than a LAN and is usually made of many different LANs, but smaller than a WAN. MAN is built by various inter connected LANs and unlike a WAN, which can cover countries or continents and may rely on third-party carriers, a MAN is typically managed by a single organization.
