# Wide Area Network (WAN)

## Quick Summary
- A WAN spans a much larger area than LANs or MANs, often across countries or continents. The Internet being a main example of WAN.  
- WANs use routers and public/private transport media (leased lines, fiber, satellite, phone lines) to link smaller networks.  

## Details
- **Not always immense:** WANs can be global (Internet) or smaller (corporate WAN linking branch offices).  
- **Centralized WAN:** Branches connect to a central hub (HQ or data center).  
- **Distributed WAN:** Resources and connections are spread across multiple locations (e.g., cloud providers, regional data centers).  
- WANs usually rely on third-party infrastructure (ISPs, telcos).  
- Built with routers, switches, leased lines, VPNs, MPLS, or satellite links.  

## Why It Matters
- Understanding WAN layout helps with troubleshooting, optimizing speeds, and securing traffic. 
- Design choice (centralized vs distributed) impacts redundancy, performance, and resilience.  
- WANs form the backbone for businesses, governments, and users to connect across regions.  

## Gotchas / Misconceptions
- The “cloud” icon in diagrams doesn’t mean the WAN is centralized — it just represents the carrier’s distributed network.  
- Security (VPNs, firewalls, encryption) isolates your traffic but doesn’t make the WAN itself private.  
- A company’s WAN design can be centralized even though the transport (Internet) is distributed.
