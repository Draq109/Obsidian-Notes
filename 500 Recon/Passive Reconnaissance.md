# Passive Reconnaissance

## Summary
Passive reconnaissance gathers information about a target without direct interaction. It minimizes the risk of detection while still collecting valuable intelligence.  

## Details
- **DNS search queries:** Discover hostnames, IP addresses, and domain records.  
- **Search engine queries:** Use Google dorks and other search engines to locate sensitive data.  
- **WHOIS lookups:** Retrieve domain registration details, ownership, and contact info.  
- **Wayback Machine:** View historical snapshots of websites to find past configurations or sensitive files.  
- **Social Media reconnaissance:** Collect data on employees and organizational structure.  
- **Code repositories (e.g., GitHub):** Search for exposed credentials, API keys, or configuration files.

## Why It Matters
- Reduces the risk of alerting the targetâ€™s security systems.  
- Can reveal sensitive data accidentally exposed by employees or through public sources.  
- Provides context and preparatory intelligence for more targeted active reconnaissance.
