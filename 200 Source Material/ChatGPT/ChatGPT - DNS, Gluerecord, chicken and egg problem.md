Q: Can you go over the glue record problem again, specifically why it would keep repeating if we were doing DNS on google.com -> ns1.google.com -> google.com -> ns1.google.com ... etc

Perfect — this is exactly the **glue record recursion problem**. Let’s walk through it step by step using your `google.com` → `ns1.google.com` example:

---

### 1. How delegation normally works

When a TLD (say `.com`) delegates a domain (like `google.com`), it lists **NS records**:

`google.com.   IN NS   ns1.google.com. google.com.   IN NS   ns2.google.com.`

So if I want to resolve `www.google.com`, my resolver asks `.com`:  
“Hey, who knows about `google.com`?”  
`.com` replies: “Ask `ns1.google.com` (and friends).”

---

### 2. The glue problem

But wait — `ns1.google.com` itself is **inside** `google.com`.  
So to find the IP address of `ns1.google.com`, I need to query… `google.com`.

That’s a **chicken-and-egg problem**:

- To resolve `google.com`, I need the IP of `ns1.google.com`.
    
- To resolve `ns1.google.com`, I need to resolve `google.com`.
    
- That loops forever. 🔁

### 3. The solution: glue records

To break the loop, the **parent zone** (`.com`) provides not just the NS name, but also an **extra A/AAAA record** with its IP:

`google.com.     IN NS   ns1.google.com. google.com.     IN NS   ns2.google.com.  ; Glue (in parent zone) ns1.google.com. IN A    216.239.32.10 ns2.google.com. IN A    216.239.34.10`

Now, when your resolver asks `.com` about `google.com`, the `.com` servers answer with both:

- “Authoritative name servers: ns1.google.com, ns2.google.com”
    
- “Oh, and here are their IP addresses (glue), so you don’t need to resolve them through me again.”
    

That **breaks the infinite recursion**.

### 4. Why the recursion would repeat without glue

If glue wasn’t given:

- Resolver asks `.com`: “Who has google.com?”
    
- `.com`: “ns1.google.com.”
    
- Resolver: “What’s the IP of ns1.google.com?”
    
- To answer that, resolver has to resolve `ns1.google.com`.
    
- But that’s in `google.com`, so it asks `.com` again.
    
- `.com` again says “Ask ns1.google.com.”
    
- And we’re back in the loop forever.

⚡ **Key idea:**

- Glue records are only necessary when the **NS is within the child zone it’s authoritative for**.
    
- If `google.com`’s NS was `ns1.dnsprovider.net`, no glue would be needed — because resolving `ns1.dnsprovider.net` doesn’t depend on knowing `google.com`.
