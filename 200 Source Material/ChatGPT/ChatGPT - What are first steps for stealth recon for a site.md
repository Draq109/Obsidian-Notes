# Answer – ChatGPT - What are first steps for stealth recon for a site

Can you help me remember the chat we had on reconing a site? We said that first would be?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yep — I remember that one. You were asking about **reconning a site** as part of your pentesting studies.

We broke it down into a **phased approach**, starting broad and then getting more targeted. The **first step we said** was:

👉 **Passive Reconnaissance (Information Gathering without touching the target directly).**

That included things like:

- Checking **WHOIS / domain registration** (owner, registrar, name servers, contact info if not hidden).
    
- Looking at **DNS records** (A, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS).
    
- Using tools like **crt.sh** or Censys to find certificates and subdomains.
    
- Searching **public sources** (Google dorks, LinkedIn, job postings, Shodan).
    
- Checking for **archived versions** of the site (like the Wayback Machine, which ties back to your current question).
    

Only _after_ exhausting passive recon do we move into **active recon** (port scanning, banner grabbing, service enumeration, etc.).

⚡ So to answer your question: the first step we had discussed was **passive recon / open-source intelligence (OSINT)** before doing anything that touches the target directly.

Do you want me to reconstruct the full recon flow we outlined (step 1 → final step) so you’ve got the sequence in front of you again?

##### You said:

Im just thinking about how to possible gather the subdomains/domains without relying on brute force methods such a gobuster, whether thats the apache webserver with its virtual hosting of domains/subdomains or targeting the DNS authoritative server for records.

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s a solid way of thinking 👌 — you’re asking _“how do I find subdomains/domains without brute-forcing?”_ which is exactly what separates **passive recon** from **active enumeration**. Let’s map it out step by step, focusing only on methods that don’t rely on hammering with wordlists:

---

## 🔎 1. Certificate Transparency Logs (CT Logs)

- Every modern HTTPS cert is logged publicly (Google’s **crt.sh**, CertSpotter, etc.).
    
- Searching a domain there often reveals subdomains (`api.example.com`, `dev.example.com`).
    
- Attackers use this because it’s free, passive, and can’t be blocked.
    

---

## 🔎 2. DNS Records & Zone Tricks

- **Public records** (A, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME). MX often points to mail subdomains.
    
- **AXFR (Zone Transfer)** — if the DNS server is misconfigured, you can request the whole zone file (rare nowadays but gold if it works).
    
- **PTR (reverse DNS lookups)** — sometimes gives away subdomains tied to an IP block.
    

---

## 🔎 3. Search Engines & Indexes

- **Google dorks**:
    
    `site:example.com -www`
    
    shows indexed subdomains.
    
- **Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex** all index differently — sometimes you’ll find subdomains one missed.
    
- **Shodan / Censys**: searchable by SSL certs, banners, reverse DNS.
    

---

## 🔎 4. ASN & IP Range Mapping

- Find the company’s **ASN** (Autonomous System Number).
    
- Map all the IP ranges.
    
- Reverse DNS on those IPs often reveals subdomains (e.g., `vpn.example.com`, `mail.example.com`).
    

---

## 🔎 5. Infrastructure Clues

- **CNAMEs** often point to 3rd-party services (`example.s3.amazonaws.com`, `example.herokudns.com`). Those can be chained back into new domains.
    
- **SPF/DMARC TXT records** sometimes reference other domains and subdomains.
    
- **Job postings, docs, GitHub leaks**: employees accidentally mention staging/test subdomains.
    

---

## 🔎 6. Historical Sources

- **Wayback Machine** (again!) — past site versions often hardcode links to forgotten subdomains.
    
- **SecurityTrails, RiskIQ, VirusTotal** — aggregate historical DNS data.
    

---

## 🔎 7. Virtual Hosting Angle (what you mentioned)

- Apache/nginx often host multiple domains on one IP (name-based virtual hosts).
    
- Passive way: use **reverse IP lookup** (tools like ViewDNS, Censys, Shodan).
    
- This can show _other domains sharing the same IP_, some of which may be part of the target org.

### ⚡ Why this matters:

You’re thinking correctly — **brute-forcing with Gobuster / FFUF hits rate limits quickly and can tip off defenses**. Passive methods get you subdomains/domains quietly, and often they’ll be more “real” because they’re from logs, certs, or DNS records, not just dictionary guesses.

---

If you want, I can put together a **workflow tree** (like: “start with CT logs → check DNS records → pivot into ASN → cross-check in Wayback”) so you have a clear non-brute-force recon playbook. Want me to draft that for you?
